# Chaos-playground-Opinion-Dynamics
#This repository contains MATLAB code coupled_ode_solver_withplots.m for simulating opinion dynamics in a system of agents across multiple topics using coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
Features

    Opinion Dynamics Model:
        Agents' opinions are represented as vectors in an Euclidean space.
        Uses coupled ODEs to model interactions and evolution of opinions over time.

    Visualization:
        Generates time series plots of opinions to visualize dynamics.
        Observes convergence or polarization based on model parameters.

Usage

    Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
    Open coupled_ode_solver_withplots.m in MATLAB.
    Modify parameters and initial conditions as needed.
    Run the script to simulate and plot the evolution of opinions.

Notes

    Adjust the script's parameters directly within coupled_ode_solver_withplots.m.
    Plot results will show how opinions change over the simulated time period.
