# Opinion Dynamics Modeling with Coupled ODE Solver

This repository contains MATLAB code `coupled_ode_solver_withplots.m` for simulating opinion dynamics in a system of agents across multiple topics using a sophisticated model. Have a look at the PDF for theoretical framework.

## Features
- **Opinion Dynamics Model**:
  - Agents' opinions are represented as vectors in an Euclidean space.
  - Uses coupled ODEs to model interactions and evolution of opinions over time.
- **Visualization**:
  - Generates time series plots of opinions to visualize dynamics.
  - Observes convergence or polarization based on a model parameter called critical controversialness (alpha).
## Notes
- Ensure MATLAB is installed in your system for running the code.
- Adjust the script's parameters directly within `coupled_ode_solver_withplots.m`.
- Plot results will show how opinions change over the simulated time period
